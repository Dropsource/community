### Feature Requests

Feature requests for Dropsource plugins are logged in our [public facing Trello board](https://trello.com/b/BCCMRu9i). 

Everything you can add to your apps in Dropsource, including Elements, Actions, and SDK integrations, is provided via plugins. The Dropsource editor exposes plugins through the Elements and Settings on the left, and the Actions you can add to Events in your app. :iphone:

{% include trello-board.html %}

If you'd like to use an Element, Action / piece of native functionality, or SDK in your Dropsource app that is not currently provided - __[fill out the plugin request form](https://goo.gl/forms/WZ5wBwMDiNUF5i552)__. The Dropsource team will either add it to the board or follow up with you to pin down any required details. We'll keep the status of each request updated in the Trello board.

{:.note-info}
> The plugin request form is not intended for Dropsource editor requests - only requests for native functionalities you want to add to the apps you build in Dropsource. _In most cases you can think of plugins as what you can include in your app, not what you do inside Dropsource itself, although there are sometimes exceptions to this where an app feature would require editor development._ 
* With feature requests for the Dropsource editor, typically more discussion and interpretation is required to bridge the gap between the user perspective and implementation practicalities - as well as framing all of this within product strategy and vision. If you'd like to make an editor feature request, or aren't sure what type your request is, [please add a topic to the forum category](https://forum.dropsource.com/c/feature-request).

{:.note-info}
> The Dropsource engineering team may not be able to build every plugin requested, but if there is enough demand, and a plugin has the potential to fulfill significant app use cases, we will do our best to create it for you. __In the future we also plan to open our plugin system up for user contributions, so we'll be able to work with community members to provide whatever app functionality you need to build your projects.__

{:.note-info}
> Please feel free to comment on existing plugin requests in the Trello board, for example if you'd like to upvote a request, please click the __Vote__ button and create a comment outlining your intended use case(s) for the native functionality in your apps. You can also __Watch__ the board or individual cards to receive status updates from Trello.
